### Introduction:  
Swiggy offers a real time tracking food delivery system. It tracks the number of items served by each restaurant, its preparation time and price. Once the restaurant provides the food, it then manages to assign the best rider to deliver the food to its customer, while letting the customer track their food chariot throughout.

## Motivation:  
Food order and delivery system is almost an essential part of today's restaurant business. Although there are existing systems with huge market share, even a small improvement to their distribution algorithms, can be a significant opportunity long term.

## https://github.com/attainu/python-project-sujay-sp-au9  
So I have created a simple food order and delivery system, to understand CSE from a production standpoint.

## The Target Applications are:  
Food order creation and restaurant database updater APIs, and once order is dispatched from my system, it is to be connected to delivery management APIs.

## Python packages used:  
Time  
Sys  
Threading  
From collections defaultdict

## OOP principles in place:  
Each order is an object of the Thread class in threading library in python
System is implemented as a class. Any number of instances of the system can be instantiated, either with an input file or terminal I/O.

## Future scope:  
Restaurant database holds a value of its respective deposit money, anytime restaurant misses a delivery, the deposit money has to reduced until minimum.
Ofcourse, without deposit restaurant is marked inactive.
